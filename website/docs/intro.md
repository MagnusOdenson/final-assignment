As a technical writer, if you are not joining an established team, you will usually face a big issue of choosing the correct tools and process to author your documentation.
There are many factors to consider before making this inevitable decision, like:

* What documentation are you creating? (Is it hardware or software?)
* Who is your target audience? (End users or software developers?)
* What approach will be the best? (Printed manual or docs as code?)

And one of those will be: `In what format should I create my source files?`

This is also one of the most critical questions that a tech writer can ask themselves, because it has impact on so many different aspects of your job.
While some of the formats are reserved for very specific use cases, for example, LaTeX - being very engineering focused with its ability to properly represent complex mathematical equations; others are much more straightforward, for example Markdown, HTML or XML.
