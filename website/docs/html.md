[HyperText Markup Language](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) (HTML) is the standard markup language used for creation of websites. While you can use raw `HTML`, you can also supplement it with [Cascading Style Sheet](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp) (`CSS`) and [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp) (`JS`) files to extend the possibilities offered by `HTML`.
CSS is responsible for giving your raw HTML file a visual side and JS is responsible for any interactive parts of your website.

In technical writing `HTML` is usually an output and rarely an input,the most often you will write in some other format and then publish to HTML. For example you write in Markdown, and then - using a static site generator like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) your Markdown content is transformed into fully fledged website with HTML, CSS and JS.

This is an example of HTML syntax:

```html
<h1>this is an example of h1</h1>
<h2>this is an example of h2</h2>
<p><i>this is an example of cursive writing</i></p>
<p><b>this is an example of bold writing</b></p>
<p>This is an example of a paragraph</p>
```
