[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (MD) is an extremely lightweight markup language created in 2004 by John Gruber.
Markdownâ€™s ease of use which has contributed to its immense - and growing - popularity. MD can be used for a number of purposes:

* Writing documentation
* Writing books
* Creating websites
* Writing notes

Markdown popularity caused it even to be used at sites like [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/), where you can use MD syntax while writing comments.
Another important value of MD is that it is extremely future proof. Unlike MS Word, it does not lock you into any kind of proprietary format; it allows you to create files in any environment - from plain text editors to code environments like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or online sites like [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/), where you can simultaneously view both your raw md input as well as an already rendered document.

An interesting thing about Markdown is that, as an open source format, it comes in various flavors. While a basic .md file will be rendered correctly in every use case, some Markdown flavors may not be supported by, for example, GitHub Pages.

This is an example of markdown syntax:

```markdown
# this is an example of h1
## this is an example of h2
*this is an example of cursive writing*
**this is an example of bold writing**
This is an example of a paragraph, it does not need any tags/markup whatsoever
```
